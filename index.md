The above are my recommendations for California Governor recall.\
If you want to know why - keep reading.
<br/>

# Question 1 - No
The recall has a good chance to let someone win with a small fraction of the vote. That's not a good democratic outcome. Governor Newsom is already up for an election in 2022!

# Question 2 - Dan Kapelovitz
Three crticial reasons for me:
 * He supports voting No for question 1 as it is bad for democracy.
 * He has an agressive platform to fight climate change. Many canidates mention water issues, fires, floods without connecting it to climage change.
 * He supports reforming California democracy so we don't have this kind of dangerous situation again.

The Democratic party explicitly choose to not run anyone as a backup in case of Newcom was recalled.
